    position: Senior Software Engineer, iOS
    duration: 09/2018 - 11/2020
    location: Singapore
    tasks:
      - Delivered 12 features and 6 engineering improvement projects for Driver team. Most of the features were massive, complex and required a lot of communication, but I still managed to deliver way ahead of time with fully unit/UI tests covered.
      - Demonstrated good adaptability by learning a new code-base of Grab iOS app (end-user) in just a few days and delivered some important features without any issues.
      - Led the unit test modularisation project, which improved build time and dependency graph significantly.
      - Increased end to end test coverage from 0% to ~31% in 3 months.
      - Improved CI stability by investigating and fixing a lot of unstable/flaky tests which required good debugging skill and being patient.

      - Took over iOS apps development (from Fossil's former team) to interact with company's products using Bluetooth Low Energy technology (Hybrid Smartwatch) for many brands (Fossil Q, Michael Kors, Emporio Armani, Kate Spade New York...). The apps support more than 20 languages (being pulled once there is an update from the server-side).
      - Increased the scalability and reusability by separating the codebase into independent pods, sharing among 10 apps for 10 diﬀerent brands.
      - Adopted the new architecture (MVVM or later is VIPER) to make the code cleaner, more manageable and testable. VIPER is fully used in the Fossil Q app, while MVVM is fully used in the other branded apps.
