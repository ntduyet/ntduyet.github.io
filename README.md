## 📁 Project Structure

The repository is organized to keep configuration, assets, and application logic cleanly separated:

| Folder/File | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **`app/`** | Contains all main application pages and components used by Next.js. |
| **`config/`** | YAML configuration files defining resume content. |
| **`public/`** | Includes static resources like images and icons. |
| **`.github/workflows/`** | GitHub Actions for automated build & deployment. |
| **`package.json`** | Lists dependencies, scripts, and project metadata. |
| **`tailwind.config.mjs`** | TailwindCSS setup for custom styles and themes. |
| **`tsconfig.json`** | TypeScript configuration for type checking and build settings. |

> 🧠 This structure is optimized for scalability — you can easily add new resume templates, pages, or configuration files as the project grows.
